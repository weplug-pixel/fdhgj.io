The TurboLift Pump is specifically designed to handle slurries containing 
froth and pulp. Its versatility also makes it suitable for general industrial slurry pumping applications. The TurboLift Pump is designed for efficient transportation of slurries containing froth, particularly suited for flotation processing applications. The TurboLift Pump effectively eliminates froth in running slurries, ensuring normal operation even with insufficient feed material. Its tangent line feeding suction accelerates slurry transportation and reduces froth.


***Design and Maintenance Advantages***
- Easy belt and pulley adjustments enable speed modifications according to working conditions.
- Interchangeable wet parts are crafted from durable materials (special alloys, rubber, or wear-resistant compounds) tailored to specific slurry properties.
- Eliminates froth during operation, even with low feed.
- Tangent line feeding suction accelerates transportation.
